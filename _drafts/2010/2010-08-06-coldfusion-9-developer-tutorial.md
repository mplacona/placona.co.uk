I'm delighted to say <a title="John Farrar" href="http://twitter.com/sosensible" target="_blank">John Farrar</a> has released his new <a title="ColdFusion 9 Developer Tutorial" href="http://www.packtpub.com/coldfusion-9-developer-tutorial/book?utm_source=placona.co.uk&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_004149" target="_blank">ColdFusion 9 Developer Tutorial</a> book, and it's now available from all the major retailers around the world.

I've already ordered mine, and am expecting to get it at some time next week.

In the meantime, I'll start reading the e-book version of it, which can also be purchased via <a title="Packt Pub" href="http://www.packtpub.com/coldfusion-9-developer-tutorial/book?utm_source=placona.co.uk&utm_medium=bookrev&utm_content=blog&utm_campaign=mdb_004149" target="_blank">Packt Website</a>.

If you're unsure about this book, I'd recommend you having a read at the <a title="ColdFusion 9 Developer Tutorial - Free chapter 4 download" href="https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/0249-chapter-4-ORM-Database-Interaction.pdf" target="_blank">freely available chapter 4</a> that can also be found on their website.

I've been asked by the publishers to write a review on this book, which I should be doing once I get the book and read it,  so watch this space.
