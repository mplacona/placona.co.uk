After almost a month without posting, today I'm posting the **first entry of the year**. Lot's of things going on and pretty busy after the holidays in Brazil.

Got tired of the sunny days and beautiful beaches to come back to the cold and wet London (I love this) ðŸ˜‰

Life is pretty much the same this year, but for some reason I predict it'll change... a lot ðŸ˜‰

Coding has been really lazy, I think I forgot this part of my brain somewhere in Brazil, but have to find it until the end of this week.

I've met some interesting people there, and will post some photos soon.

I know it's a bit late, but **happy new year** to everybody and I promise I'll post loads of interesting stuff during this year.
