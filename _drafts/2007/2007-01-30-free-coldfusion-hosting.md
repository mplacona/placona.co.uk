So it seems that <a href="http://www.easycfm.com" target="_blank">Pablo Varando</a> is inovating once more. Now it's time to provide free ColdFusion hosting.

The <a href="http://www.freecoldfusionhosting.com/" target="_blank">website</a> is still under construction, but if you have a look at the home, you can see some very interesting features that will e provided really for free.

The free websites will have some kind of adds, but it's still worth in case you don't use your website for commercial purposes. Just a brief description of features enabled for FREE in this service:

  * 1GB Hard Disk Space
  * 5GB Bandwidth (Monthly data)
  * 1 MS SQL Database
  * ColdFusion MX 7.1 (Enterprise License)
  * Unlimited Email Accounts

Looks very good to me! What about you?
