As usual Raymond Camden is always trying to make our lives easier with his free tools.

Now it's time for a ColdFusion version of Firebug. For those who don't know, Firebug is a very handy FireFox extension for debugging Ajax and DOM. And this one will be used for ColdFusion.

**Thanks Ray!!!**

**UPDATE:** I forgot to mention <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2IX25DTK2ITG6/ref=wl_web" target="_blank">Adam Podolnick</a> on the original post. He worked on the Firefox side. Thanks Adam
