Yes, I was really expecting for this new version, and now it finally came up.

Take a look at [here](http://www.getrailo.com?CFID=0f557aa3-3d2c-4c65-9ec2-ef07be19de3a&CFTOKEN=0) to see what's new, and download the <a style="color:red" href="http://www.getrailo.com?CFID=20f27818-0046-4b05-8b86-c917cbe7240f&CFTOKEN=0">FREE</a> server here.

Also, I'd like to encourage people to take some time and click on the donate button (paypal) on the top of the downloading page and give the guys some money.

They've been doing an excellent job!
