Just a quick post about a book I've just spotted. 

Jeff Peters from [Proton Arts](http://www.protonarts.com) has (just??) released a book on Fusebox 5.5 called "[How to Drive Fusebox 5.5](http://www.protonarts.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Books.showBookDetails&ISBN=0975264761)"

The book costs just $19,99 (a tenner) and has a delivery of $7,00 to England as far as I could see.

I don't know about you guys, but I totally missed this one, and it's been a very long time I don't see a book release on Fusebox.

Might be worth checking this one.
