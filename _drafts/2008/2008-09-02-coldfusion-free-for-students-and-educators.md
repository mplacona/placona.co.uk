Today, [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com) has finally released the [portal](https://freeriatools.adobe.com/coldfusion/){.broken_link} for educators and students as previously mentioned at the CFUnited 2008.
  
It's great news, asÂ Adobe will finally be able to target the Universities and Schools with ColdFusion, and maybe in a near future our kids will be able to learn some ColdFusionÂ in school ðŸ˜‰
  
A [friend](http://www.tofinha.com.br/cftofinha/){.broken_link} of mine has [been working](http://www.tofinha.com.br/cftofinha/){.broken_link} with Universities since the beginning of this year and has recently had some success with over 28 university students learning ColdFusion.
  
28 students may sound like a quite small number, but remember, he and a couple of other guys are just doing that for the sake of ColdFusion, and don't get any special attention ($$$)Â from Adobe.
  
Maybe after this release today, their job will be a bit easier, as some of the universities may adopt ColdFusion to it's grades.
