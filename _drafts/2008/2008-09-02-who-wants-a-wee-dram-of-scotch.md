On the last week, [Wee Dram](http://www.andyjarrett.co.uk/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=03A69A02-3048-7B3E-09D63B537B5B3AFF) has been announced. It's organized by the same guys doing <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scotch On The Rocks</a>, so it's a "must go".
  
This time it's gonna be in London at the [Square Pig](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=WC1R+4QG&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr), in Holborn, and it's a replacement for the sadly cancelled [CFDEVCON](http://cfdevcon.com/){.broken_link}.
  
Some of the CFDevcon's US speakers will be there, as well as all the great European speakers we already know.
  
I'll post some information here about what will happen there:
  
**Where:**
  
[Square Pig](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=WC1R+4QG&ie=UTF8&z=16&iwloc=addr)
  
30 - 32 Proctor Street
  
Holborn
  
London
  
WC1R 4QG
  
**When:**
  
Thursday 25th September 2008, 10am to 6pm
  
**Schedule:**
  
10:00 - Key Note - From Adam Lehman & Claude Englebert
  
11:00 - Break
  
11:15 - Coldspring by Mark Drew

So, it's almost the same price you'd pay for two pints in the same area, and you still get to see many **ColdFusion** stars, there's no excuse for this one!
