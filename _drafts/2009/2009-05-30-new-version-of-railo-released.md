This is only a point release (3.1.0.015) for Railo, but it addresses many bugs we reported in the last couple of weeks. Moreover, when I say last couple of weeks, it really is it. It is breath taking to see how quickly the Railo team nails down all of our requests and bug reports. Railo is still in beta, but according to Gert, it will soon have its final version released (Gert says it is sometime in June 2009).
  
Updating could not be any easier if you are on Railo 3.1x already. Simply go to your server admin, click on updates in the left menu, and click the button execute update. It's all done via admin interface, and there's no need to move *.jar files or anything.
