Yesterday, the guys over at <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/" target="_blank">Mango Blog </a>(engine running this blog) released an update to it, and a few hours later another one (1.3.1). I still don't have all the information about what changes, but I'll be updating this post as soon as I get the information.
  
If you are running Mango Blog on a version above 1.2.2., you should be able to login into your administrator, and click update, so you can have it updated automatically.

For those running versions bellow 1.2.2, you have to wait until the updater is available on <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/docs/downloads" target="_blank">Mango's website</a>, as running the installer again will overwrite all your files and changes, and is not necessary.
