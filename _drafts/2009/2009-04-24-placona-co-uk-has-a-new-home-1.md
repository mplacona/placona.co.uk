It took me quite a while to come back and write this post, but finally placona.co.uk is in a new home.

Most of you will remember that I've been using <a name="http://www.crystaltech.com/">crystaltech</a> for quite a while, and they have been great up to this year when I decided to migrate to CF8. I was using CF7 with SQL Server up to then, but made the horrible mistake of upgrading to CF8 + mySQL.

I can't really complain about their support, as it's always been really good, but I have to be honest and say that when I really needed them, they turned their back to me, and were quite rude in a few of their answers. But anyway.... water under the river.

I then decided I should stop being a girl, and set-up my own server. That way I'd have real freedom to do whatever I please, and configure the server exactly how I want to.

Obviously my choice was for a VPS, where I'll be running Apache + Railo + Resin and mySQL.

I'll make a big post this weekend describing all the procedures I used to get the server up and running, as well as the configurations I've made to optimize my <a href="https://manage.slicehost.com/customers/new?referrer=364963b4bf874397d68118e4a711817a" target="_blank" class="broken_link">256mb box.</a>

Keep an eye on this space
