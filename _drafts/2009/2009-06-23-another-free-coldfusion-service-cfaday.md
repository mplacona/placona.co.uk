I've just published the last piece of the puzzle. For those who read <a title="Free ColdFusion Services" href="https://www.placona.co.uk/150/coldfusion/two-new-and-free-coldfusion-services-for-you/" target="_blank">my last blog post</a>, you should be already familiar with the "a day series"
  
It's a small set of applications aimed to all ColdFusion Developers who want to go the extra mile, and not limit their knowledge to only a small set of information.
  
The functionality is pretty simple, you set one of the URL's as your homepage, and every time you open a new page/tab, it shows you a new ColdFusion function or tag deppending on the flavor you chose.
  
I'm now publishing the version that includes it all:



This last bit, includes all the current ColdFusion Functions and Tags mixed together, and works the same way as the previous versions. Again I'd encourage everybody to try it, and use it in a daily basis. it's incredible how much I've been learning in the past few days just by giving a quick read on every new tab I open.
  
If you find any problem, or have any comment aout it, please let me know, and I shall fix it.
