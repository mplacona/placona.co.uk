As the interest for the <a title="ColdFusion Markup Language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language" target="_blank">CFML language</a> has been growing a lot in the last few months due to its <a title="Open Source Railo" href="http://www.getrailo.org/" target="_blank">open source engine</a> just being <a class="noBorder" title="Placona.co.uk - The day finally came" href="https://www.placona.co.uk/112/railo/the-day-finally-came/" target="_self">released</a>, I decided to start this series of CFML posts for beginners.
  
I intend to cover CFML development from scratch here, and also give some hints and tips regarding sever configuration, [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment "Integrated Development Environment")'s, best practices and a liitle bit on [frameworks](http://www.carehart.org/cf411/#cffw "ColdFusion frameworks") as well.
  
I will also be accepting user suggestions, where **you** can use my [contact form](https://www.placona.co.uk/contact-me/ "Placona.co.uk - Contact Form"){.noBorder} <span class="noBorder">in order to request new topics to be added.</span>
