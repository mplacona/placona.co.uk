Yes, I went on and got into [Mango's plugin development](http://www.mangoblog.org/docs/documentation/extending-mango/creating-a-plugin). Basically on Saturday I was a bit bored monitoring [my new server's](https://www.placona.co.uk/114/railo/placona-co-uk-has-a-new-home-1/) performance, and decided to look at plugins development for <a href="http://www.mangoblog.org/" target="_blank">Mango Blog</a>.
  
It's pretty straight forward really, and you only have to create a few files with some pre-defined functions, and off you go.
  
I always wanted to have a way of nicely asking for donations in my blog. We all know how much this things cost, and sometimes you need to step back, and kindly ask your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">five</span> readers to make some donations in order to support your infrastructure and the efforts you make to always give a nice experience to them.
  
Of course I wouldn't simply place a link to PayPal on the sidebar, so I decided to create this plugin. And that's why in this post, I'm presenting:

# **BeerMe**

BeerMe is a plugin for Mango Blog that allows you to add a link to PayPal at the bottom of each post. The links are personalized, so you can keep track of which blog post generated more donations.

It's totally open source, and I still intend to make some changes to it; Also I'll add a nice image to go with the paypal link (as soon as I have some time to create this image).
  
An example of the plugin can be seen at the enf of this post, right bellow the bookmark links, and above the tweetbacks. Why not click the link and make your donation? ðŸ˜‰
