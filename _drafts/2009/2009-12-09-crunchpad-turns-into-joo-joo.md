I've been following the recent news about **CrunchPad**, and for all of our disappointment, [it's been discontinued](http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/30/crunchpad-end/ "Crunchpad is dead") due to a "misunderstanding" between the guys from <a title="TechCrunch" href="http://techcrunch.com/" target="_blank">TechCrunch </a>and Fusion Garage, who were developing this together.
  
Now, today it's been announced that the CrunchPad has been reborn (as Joo Joo), and will indeed be released by the guys over at Fusion Garage. Apparently the whole deal was because Fusion Garage decided to ditch [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/ "TechCrunch"), and release it alone.
  
I strongly disagree with this kind of behaviour, and really hope the guys over TechCrunch find a way to stop it.
  
It's due to go on sale on the 11th of December, with a price tag of $499. You can read more about it on [Engadget's website](http://www.engadget.com/2009/12/08/joojoo-tablet-hands-on-video/ "Engadged: JooJoo").
