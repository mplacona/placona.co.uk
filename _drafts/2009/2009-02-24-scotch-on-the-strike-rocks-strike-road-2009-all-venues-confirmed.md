Just as a follow up to my <a href="https://www.placona.co.uk/88/coldfusion/scotch-on-the-rocks-2009/" target="_blank">last post</a>, I just wanted to put this quick note here to tell everybody that all the venues for <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scotch on the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Rocks</span> Road 2009</a> have been confirmed.
  
You can also download your Speaker, Attendee, Drinker or Fanboy badges <a href="http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/?do=promo.view" target="_blank">here</a>, and put them on your website, so it looks as cool as mine does.
