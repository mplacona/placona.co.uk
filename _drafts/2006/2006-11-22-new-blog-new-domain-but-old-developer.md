As you can see I'm back blogging. Now I've got a brand new domain and host. The contents will still be pretty much the same. ColdFusion, CFEclipse, Java, Flex and all this new stuff coming up.

For those who want to know a little bit more about me, just go and click the link "About me". **But wait!** The blog is still under construction, so the "About me" area is still not available, but will be very soon. 

As soon as I can have some spare time to write something about me and change this blog's colour and layout.

I promise I'll try to post something at least every 2 or 3 days.

Hope you enjoy it!
