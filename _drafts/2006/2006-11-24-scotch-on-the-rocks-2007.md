Wooow it seems that we now have one more scheduled conference here in the UK for the next year.

[Scotch on the Rocks](http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/) is a UK conference run by the Scottish CFUG, sponsored by Adobe and will take place on May 31st and June 1st in Edinburgh.

The confirmed [speakers](http://www.scotch-on-the-rocks.co.uk/index.cfm?do=speakers.view){.broken_link} at the moment are: Tim Buntel (Adobe), Mark Drew (CFEclipse), Kev McCabe (Sky) and Niklas Richardson (Prismix)

I look forward to see all the UK developers there and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">drink a lot</span> learn a lot from this conference ðŸ™‚

GOD BLESS MR. JACK DANIEL'S!!!

See you all in Edinburgh!
