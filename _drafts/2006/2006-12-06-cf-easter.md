I was reading <a href="http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm/2006/12/6/What-Is-Your-Favorite-Easter-Egg" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CFSilence today</a> and saw Todd Sharp's post asking what's your favorite easter eggs. He's talking about website easter eggs, but I just remembered one which is not on a website, but on ColdFusion MX

Yeah that's right, it's on your ColdFusion administrator.

If you wanna see it, just open your IE (6 or 7), go to: Tools -> Internet Options -> Languages. there you add a new custom language called CFML

Then go to your ColdFusion Administrator and click on System Settings and a pop-up should show up.

It works on either CFMX 6 to 7.2 or Scorpio. I guess I can add this to my Scorpio Checklist ðŸ˜‰

Have fun...

**UPDATE: Make CFML the first language on the list otherwise it won't work**
