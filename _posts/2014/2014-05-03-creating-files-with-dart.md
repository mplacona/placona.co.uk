This is a very simple example of how to create files with Dart. I am working on another example that involves file manipulation, but thought I'd quickly post this one here as to have it out of the way.

In this post I will show you quickly how to create a text file using Futures in Dart. The example will:

  * create the file
  * write some content to it synchronously
  * return a message when the contents have been written

Our code will therefore go as follows:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1453 size-full" src="/images/2014/05/dart_create_file_big.png" alt="Dart - Create File" width="751" height="302" srcset="/images/2014/05/dart_create_file_big.png 751w, images/2014/05/dart_create_file_big-300x120.png 300w, images/2014/05/dart_create_file_big-676x271.png 676w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px" />

The gist can also be found on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/mplacona/a7fa2033a56e14471ebf "Create files in dart - Gist").
