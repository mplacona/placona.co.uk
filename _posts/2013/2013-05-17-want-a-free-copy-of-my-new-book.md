No catches here, all you need to do to get a free e-copy of my new book

<a title="Instant jQuery Drag-and-Drop Grids How-to, Packt Pub" href="http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-drag-and-drop-grids/book" target="_blank">jQuery Drag-and-Drop Grids How-to</a> (<a title="jQuery Drag-and-Drop Grids How-to UK Link" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1782165002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1782165002&linkCode=as2&tag=marplasblo-21" target="_blank">UK</a> , <a title="jQuery Drag-and-Drop Grids How-to, US Link" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1782165002/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1782165002&linkCode=as2&tag=placona-20" target="_blank">US</a>)

Is read the book, and then write a review of it on your blog.

And I'm not asking you to write a good (or biased) review either. I'm just asking for some feedback. I've had a couple of people already writing reviews on their blogs, Google+ and Amazon, but more the merrier. And I want to know what **YOU** think!

For those who haven't seen my [previous blog post](https://www.placona.co.uk/1235/javascript/i-am-a-published-author/) about having published this book, this is my first ever book, and while I have written hundreds of technical articles, none of them have actually made this far on the "publishing chain".

And this is why I want to have all the feedback I can get. Again, **YOU** are the sort of person who buys the sort of books I write, and it's **YOU** I wanna hear from.

There are 5 free e-copies up for grabs, Â and I'll give it away to the first 5 people who show interest in reading and reviewing my book.

Well, that's gotta save you some money eh?

So get in touch by leaving a comment to this post, or via contact form with your name and blog URL. I'll then get you your free copy, and all I ask in return is to be notified when you've published your review.
