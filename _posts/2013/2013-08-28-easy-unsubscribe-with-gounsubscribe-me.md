I've created a new website over the last weekend and would like to share it here with you.

I've spent an entire day without checking my emails on Saturday, and when I finally got around to do it, there was a ton of useless crap in it. My spam filters are pretty good, but won't pickup on things I (un)intentionally subscribed for.

The very act of purchasing something online will sometimes auto-subscribe you to the store's monthly, weekly and daily newsletter until the end of era.

By osmosis, I will normally delete all the email from my inbox and just get on with my life.

This time though, I decided I'd also unsubscribe from some of them. Some were easy enough, as every good citizen knows to add an unsubscribe link to the bottom of the email.

Some others though, will make the assumption you love to get their newsletters about their huge selection of garden hoses.

While unsubscribing, I though maybe some other people may want to make use of the unsubscription links, so I decided to collate them all, and put them together on a <a title="GoUnsubscribe.me" href="http://www.gounsubscribe.me/" target="_blank" class="broken_link">collaborative website</a>.

The idea is very simple, find what you would like to unsubscribe from, and the link will take you straight to their unsubscription page.

> What if my link isn't there?

You can just add it. Simply go ahead to the <a title="GoUnsubscribe.me on GitHub" href="https://github.com/mplacona/gounsubscribe.me" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>, fork the project, make your changes, and send me a pull request.

Adding a new URL is as simple as:

<img class="aligncenter" alt="Adding a new URL to GoUnsubscribe.com" src="https://raw.github.com/mplacona/gounsubscribe.me/master/public/images/gounsubscribe.gif" width="842" height="296" />

And you can also collaborate with the project itself, but changing any of the files, adding new functionalities or making the layout look a bit prettier.

So check [GoUnsubscribe.me](http://www.gounsubscribe.me "GoUnsubscribe.me"){.broken_link} out!

And [fork me on GitHub](https://github.com/mplacona/gounsubscribe.me "Fork GoUnsubscribe.me on GitHub")
