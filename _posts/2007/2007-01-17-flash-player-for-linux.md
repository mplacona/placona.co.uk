They finally made it! **Adobe** just released the **Flash Player for Linux**.
  
Now Linux users can deploy apps using the free Adobe FlexÂ® 2 Software Developers Kit (SDK), Adobe Flash Player 9 and Flex Data Services 2 Express.
  
All this for free... nothing... nada... niente!
  
So if you're using Linux, it's **a must** to go to [www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayerlinux](http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/ "Flash player Linux") and download it now!
