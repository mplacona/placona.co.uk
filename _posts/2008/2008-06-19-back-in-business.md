Well, I know it's been a real long time since my last post here (dating over a year...).

In fact I've been just involved in lots of other projects <strike>lazy</strike> and didn't really have time to update.

As some of you may know, I've been working for the EU Commission for over a year now, and for some reason, the firewall blocked my blog (note that I still didn't post pics from naked chicks or stuff), and I simply let it be. Till yesterday when I found out that my blog has been massively attacked by bloody spammers, and was fully packed with nasty URL's. Maybe this is the reason why it was blocked by the firewall in first instance.

I did a good clean-up on it, and now it should be OK.

There's some stuff I want to post here later, so stay tuned for some exciting stuff about the new ColdFusion version (codename Centaur)
