Well, I decided to start this topic after realizing that us, Adobe / CF developers kinda know each other from other web blogs, twitter, messenger etc, but sometimes don't know much more than that.

So for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">three</span> many people who read my blog, I decided to talk a little bit about me, and would like to encourage all of you <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(thee guys)</span> to do the same, and link to this post, so I can keep track.

It shouldn't be like the "about me" section, but more of a "about me now".
  
So let's start:

**Current work:**
  
EU Commission;
  
****
  
**Team size:**
  
4 here (plus the hundred others in the other buildings)
  
****
  
**Main Technologies used:**
  
ColdFusion MX 7 and Oracle;
  
****
  
**Projects**
  
Mainly internal apps involving a massive CMS, resource management, Action Management and Business Objects;
  
****
  
**Current Studies**
  
JQuery, BO
  
****
  
**Next Studies**
  
Maybe AIR...
  
****
  
**Current Hobbies**
  
Electronics as usual
  
****
  
**What will happen next?**
  
Will probably return to UK (as soon as I find a cool job)
