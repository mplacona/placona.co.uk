Yes! It'll happen again. Following the successful conference that [happened in 2006](http://www.placona.co.uk/), [Nick Tong](http://www.coldfusioncommunity.org/profile/nicktong){.broken_link}, [Russ Michaels](http://www.michaels.me.uk/) and [Richard Cooper](http://propertyowl.co.uk/) has decided to do it again.

This year they are packed with some [great speakers](http://www.cfdevcon.com/speakers.cfm){.broken_link}, and some of the hottest topics ever.

Just a small compilation of some of the speakers they will have this year:

  1. Aral Balkan
  2. Peter Bell
  3. Sean Corfield
  4. Mark Drew
  5. Hal Helms
  6. <strike>Ray Camden</strike> (can't make it)

and much more...

And after all that, you still get to hit the beach, as the conference this year will be happening in [Brighton](http://www.cfdevcon.com/venue.cfm){.broken_link}.

So what else do you need to go to [cfdevcon's](http://www.cfdevcon.com/){.broken_link} website and buy your early bird ticket (only till 30th of June)?

On my [old post](http://www.placona.co.uk/) about CFDevcon 2006 you can a bit about what were my impressions about the 2006 conference, and make sure that you'll most definitely see me there again

More to come....
