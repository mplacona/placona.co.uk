Well known in the ColdFusion community, [Charlie Arehart](http://www.carehart.org/) has come up with the new [CF411 site](http://www.carehart.org/cf411/)

It counts with an extraordinary amount of tools and resources related to the CFML Language.

Text extracted from the website:

_How often do you see a question asked on a list, **"does anyone know where I can find CFML resources about xxx", or "what tools are available to do yyy?"**. Now you have one place you can point people to answer most such questions._ 

Well done Charlie!
