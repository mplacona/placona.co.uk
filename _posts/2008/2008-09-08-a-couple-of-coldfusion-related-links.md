I came across this morning to two excellent ColdFusion related articles, and thought it'd be interesting to share it with my readers.

The first one is an excellent article from Hal Helms about **Object-oriented** programming using ColdFusion

[Object-oriented programming: Using inheritance wisely](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/oo_coldfusion.html)

The second one is really great news, and the title says it all!

[Why developers are dumping PHP for ColdFusion](http://www.techpluto.com/coldfusion-over-php/)
