I've been following closely all the comments and blog posts from the guys at CFUnited 08.
  
I've managed to compile a list with all the new functionalities announced yesterday 18/06/08 for the ColdFusion 9 (codename Centaur).
  
This is still work in progress, and I'm still scavenging into all the blogs and twitter posts to amend my list, but here are the key points I've go so far.
  
ColdFusion 9 will:

  * have hibernate running native;
  * have implicit get/set methods in CFC's;
  * have new LOCAL scope in functions;
  * give you the possibility to create CFC's in cfscript (more on that later);
  * have a 100% free enterprise edition for students and educators;

So far, I've been really impressed by all the points here, as some of them are really ticking items on my complaint's list.
  
It seems that Adobe is still interested in ColdFusion (contrary to what some people think), and are really investing on it (the free editions for students tells it by itself)
  
One of my main complaints about ColdFusion was that it wouldn't let you use OO properly (I've mentioned this hundreds of times), and now, it seems to be being addressed in a very gentle way.
  
Well keep an eye here to read more about the new functionalities for CF9
