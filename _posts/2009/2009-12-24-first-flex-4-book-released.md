The first Flex 4 book ([Hello! Flex 4](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1933988762?tag=marplasblo-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=1933988762&adid=14G9ZNKFFA55W99NECZ6& "Hello! Flex 4")) has just been released this month in the UK. I haven't read it yet, so no way I could give any reviews on it, but from the interwebs, I can see it's contents are really good. A must buy for the festive period.
