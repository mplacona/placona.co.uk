We all know how painful it is to keep up to date with our meeting and
  
obligations. I've recently been thinking of a nice way to sync my calendars
  
from work and personal into a single account.
  
I then had a very specific spec for it, which is as follows:

  * I need to get my calendar pushed to my iPhone;
  * The calendar must be a merge of my personal calendar, and my business
      
    calendar;
  * I still want to be able to pick up my google mail emails;
  * I **DO NOT** want it to pick up my business emails (as I prefer to
      
    pick them up another way);
  * The calendar must be available anywhere and at anytime

Obviously <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=cl&passive=1209600&continue=http://www.google.com/calendar/render&followup=http://www.google.com/calendar/render&scc=1" target="_blank">Google Calendar</a> springs to mind, as we
  
all know it's online, and basically that pretty much makes sure you have your
  
calendar anywhere (as long as you have internet connection). It takes the last
  
item off my list, as it's available anywhere, but i still had to work on the
  
other three items, and here's what I did:
  
First of all, you need to make sure you iPhone software is at least on
  
version 2.2, otherwise this **won't** work.
  
I the downloaded <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.google.com/sync/index.html" target="_blank">Google Calendar Sync</a> and
  
installed it. It's very straoght forward, as you only need to put your account
  
details into it, and say what kind of sync you wanna have.
  
In my case, I chose **1-way: Microsoft Outlook Calendar to google
  
Calendar.** this pretty much tells your MS Outlook Calendar to synch with
  
Google Calendar every x minutes.

I then checked my Google Calendar, and everything was there. Excellent, I
  
just had to make it sync with my iPhone's Calendar.
  
I then found some information over at Google's website. I'll describe the
  
next steps here

  * Open **Settings** on your iphone;
  * Open **Mail**, **Contacts**, **Calendars**.;
  * Tap **Add Account;**
  * Select **Microsoft Exchange;**
  * Put an account name in the **email** field (not your actual google
      
    mail email);
  * Don't put anything on **domain;**
  * put your google mail's email address on **username;**
  * put your password (in the **password** field);
  * Click **next;**
  * A **server** field will appear;
  * Enter **m.google.com;**
  * Click **next** and sync;

Make sure you select only calendars, as you have your email account already
  
configured.
  
And that should be it. in case you have different calendars in different
  
computers, you can simply follow the same steps of installation for each
  
computer, and your iPhone settings should remain the same, as everything comes
  
from Google Calendar.
