UPDATEI'm constantly finding new tools that help me to use <a href="http://twitter.com/marcos_placona" target="_blank">my twitter account</a> in a better way. Some of the tools are really great, but I can't be bothered to remember all of the URLs, and bookmarking doesn't seem to help at all.
  
So I decided to compile a list and post here. I'll update the list as I find new tools, so keep an eye on this space, and instead of bookmarking all the url's, simply [bookmark this post](http://www.placona.co.uk/97/misc/my-top-favourite-twitter-tools/ "Placona.co.uk - My top favourite twitter tools"){.jqbookmark}.
