I've just seen this video and thought I'd share it with my few readers. It appears that a Norwegian lad found a way to boot Windows Mobile OS on the iPhone. According to him, it works pretty much like bootcamp, so you can select which OS to boot.

The video is pretty convincing and does really look real, but I'll keep this post updated in case I find something else about it.
