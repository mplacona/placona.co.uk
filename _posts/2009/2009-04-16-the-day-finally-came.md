And of course I was out of the country and then too busy to even read anything about it.

[Railo](http://www.getrailo.com) has just been made open source and officially accepted as a [JBoss.org Project](http://www.getrailo.org)

After the great news, we came to know that some [great](http://www.getrailo.com/com/index.cfm/about-us/railo-team/peter-bell/) [names](http://www.getrailo.com/com/index.cfm/about-us/railo-team/mark-drew/) have been added to the team, so I'd like to wish [Railo](http://www.getrailo.com) the best of luck, and hope they keep going up and up and up.

I really want to see what the fan boys have to say about CFML not being open source now ðŸ˜‰
