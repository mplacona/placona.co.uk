According to Michael Offner-Streit (Railo CTO) at the <a title="Railo user group" href="http://groups.google.com/group/railo" target="_blank">Railo user Group</a>:

> "Railo is the name of the first alien dog ever seen in <a title="Star Trek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek" target="_blank">Star Trek</a>. His name is Rhylo and because my english is not very good I have written it wrong, Sorry ;-)"

Which leads to an interesting question:

How do you pronounce Railo?
