Last week it came to my attention that <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html" target="_blank">ColdFusion</a> is being used by <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-standard/reviews-awards.html" target="_blank">75 of the Fortune 100 companies</a>. Then, I was also informed that <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html" target="_blank">ColdFusion</a> was ranked in the <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.evansdata.com/reports/viewRelease_download.php?reportID=20" target="_blank">top four application servers</a> by developers, just behind <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/" target="_blank">Websphere</a>, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://geronimo.apache.org/" target="_blank">Geronimo</a> and <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/windows-server/default.aspx" target="_blank">Windows Server.</a>
  
In the last couple of weeks, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html" target="_blank">ColdFusion</a> has been "the big fuss" of the world wide web. It's totally scalable, and the learning curve is smaller than any other web language currently out there.

My question is:
  
What else do you need to crack on with <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion.html" target="_blank">ColdFusion development</a>? It's **FREE** <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.placona.co.uk/70/coldfusion/coldfusion-free-for-students-and-educators/" target="_self">for educational purposes</a>, you can have **FREE** <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.placona.co.uk/82/coldfusion/free-coldfusion-8-hosting/" target="_self" class="broken_link">hosting for development</a>, there's a flawless **FREE** <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.placona.co.uk/105/coldfusion/coldfusion-freebies/" target="_self">training material</a> and a **GREAT** <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.placona.co.uk/106/coldfusion/official-list-of-coldfusion-people-on-twitter/" target="_self">community</a>.

I'd appreciate comments on that matter, as well as questions from people who might be thinking of starting with <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html" target="_blank">ColdFusion</a>, but are still unsure about a thing or another.
