I have just came across this very nice service which promises to write <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" target="_blank">Regular Expressions</a> for you.
  
We all know how painful writing a regular expression can be, and on this website, you can not only have the pattern created for you, but also have it translated into the most common languages on the web.
  
I've tried it myself, and can say it's pretty darn good, although it's automatic generator gives you a lot of "_functional-crap_" sometimes, it's good for when you're in a hurry and need to have a pattern up and running, or is not very confident with regexps.
