The <a href="http://blog.jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">jQuery UI team</a> has just started a weekly series on what's happening with jQuery UI.

They will be posting a sort of digest on a weekly basis talking about releases, and news.

This week they came up with a list of companies using jQuery UI:

  * ESPN
  * Capcom Europe
  * LiveSlices
  * DotNetShoutout

And to my surprise I was mentioned on the book section, due to my <a href="http://www.placona.co.uk/99/jquery/jquery-ui-1-6-book-review/" target="_blank">book review</a> on jQuery UI 1.6: The User Interface Library for jQuery.
  
They've also featured some tutorials and a Q&A
