As announced last week, [CFSilence](http://cfsilence.com/blog/client/index.cfm){.broken_link} is running the CFeMmys, which according to Todd Sharp is:

_CFeMmys is to recognize the blogs, lists, forums, community sites, publications, etc that made the biggest contributions and impact to the online ColdFusion community._

And guess what? My blog is listed in some of the categories. Well, now it's down to me to ask my mum, dad, sister, girlfriend and friends to go there and vote ðŸ˜‰

Well done Todd!
