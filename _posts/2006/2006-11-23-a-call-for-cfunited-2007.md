It just came to my attention yesterday night (I've been pretty busy this week). The registration for the CFUNITED 2007 is now open.

For those who don't know (I doubt), CFUNITED is the biggest ColdFusion conference in the planet. The first conference happened in 1999 and had just some few attendants. Now it counts with 1000+ developers every year.

This year's conference will take place in June, from the 27th to 30th in North Bathesda, MD (Just outside DC). Check ou the website for [CFUNITED 2007](http://cfunited.com/2007/)

The prices are good specially for us living in the UK and paying in Â£ ðŸ™‚

I'm really thinking about doing it next year. Anyone else?
