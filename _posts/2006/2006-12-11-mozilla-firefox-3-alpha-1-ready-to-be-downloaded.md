Yes, it seems that Mozilla just released the new version of Firefox codenamed Gran Paradiso.

I'm writing this post using it.

It's still on alpha 1 version, but seems to be very stable until now.

So, so go to [Gran Paradiso's](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/devpreview/releasenotes/) home page and download your copy.
