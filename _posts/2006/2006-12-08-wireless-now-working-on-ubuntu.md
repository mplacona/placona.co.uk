As [previously](https://www.placona.co.uk/30/misc/ubuntu-experience/) [said](https://www.placona.co.uk/32/coldfusion/coldfusion-on-ubuntu/) I was having some kind of troubles with my wireless connection on Ubuntu.

Yesterday I found that the Ubuntu community really works. I was able to get some replies about how to install my wireless using WPA encryption in less than 5 minutes.

Basically Ubuntu only works with WEP encryption, which is crap by the way. When switching my router to work with WEP encryption, I got Ubuntu wireless to work, but Windows XP gone down.

The guys from the Ubuntu community pointed me to a [URL](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=263136) that promissed to make Ubuntu work for almos every single wireless card.

Guess what? It does indeed, in less than 5 minutes I managed to have my wireless connection working on WPA.

Now as promissed I'm doing this post from my Ubuntu on wireless connection
