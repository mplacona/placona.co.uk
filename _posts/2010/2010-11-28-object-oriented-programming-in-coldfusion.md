I know it must be pretty old news by now that Matt Gifford has written a book called <a title="Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion" href="http://www.packtpub.com/object-oriented-programming-in-coldfusion/book" target="_blank">Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion</a>.

I've been approached by the folks at Packt last week and asked to read it and write a review about the book.

I'm still waiting for it to be delivered, but will be writing the review as soon as I'm done with the book. In the meantime, you can have a sneak peek of the [sample chapter](https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/6323-chapter-1-introducing-coldfusion-components.pdf) or [buy the book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847196322?ie=UTF8&tag=marplasblo-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1847196322 "Buy the book") directly.
