It just came to my attention that CFEclipse 1.3.5 has been released, and as usual I am a bit late announcing it.
  
From the <a title="What's new on CFEclipse 1.3.5" href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/update/web/doc/intro/doc/new.html" target="_blank" class="broken_link">what's new</a> page, we can see that loads have been added to it, but the highlights in my opinion are:

  1. Proposal Categories
  2. Function Proposals
  3. An option to automatically format code
  4. Occurrence marking, which will automatically highlight all the occurrences of a selected string
  5. Opening Files from the OS (<a title="CFEclipseCall" href="http://trac.cfeclipse.org/wiki/CFEclipseCall" target="_blank" class="broken_link">CFEclipseCall</a>)

  Well done to the CFEclipse team!
