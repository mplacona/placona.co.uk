Ok, I know I'm late on this, but I just thought I'd register here that Adobe Flash Player 10.2 has just been released on the <a title="Adobe Labs" href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer.html" target="_blank">Adobe Labs</a> this week.

A few of it's key features are:

  * Stage Video hardware acceleration
  * Internet Explorer 9 hardware accelerated rendering support
  * Native custom mouse cursors
  * Support for full screen mode with multiple monitors

Here's a video preview from Adobe Max 2010:
